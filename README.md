I want to create a web-based application that allows the user to see any place 
of interest around the world. I will design my website in order to look 
pleasent to the viewers.

This website will also have reviews in order to help the user to see other 
opinions about the place from people who have already visited it. 
Besides, if they want to leave a review, they can log in and do so. 
For this I will develop a login mechanism.

Moreover, for the sake of simplicity and convenience of the user, 
he will also have the option of adding the selected place to the 
Favourite section, if he likes it. So later he can see briefly 
only the places he wants to visit.

For this I will integrate to my application a travel webcam API, 
such as Webcams.travel API.
